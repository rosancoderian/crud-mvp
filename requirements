Relations:
Instructions can have multiple steps, each step belongs to only one instruction

Each model has two users assigned by two fields: created_by, updated_by


Functionality:
Save user on create/update a model (into created_by, updated_by)
Save timestamp on create/update a model (into created_at, updated_at)


Bonus 1:
Only show the step attached_file field, if the step type is not text

Bonus 2:
Use a soft delete behavior. Add deleted_by, deleted_at to every model which is set on deletion. Listview only lists the entries without a value on deleted_at

Bonus 3:
Add a filter/search for one or multiple columns of your choice
Add a sort (asc/desc) option for one or multiple columns of your choice
